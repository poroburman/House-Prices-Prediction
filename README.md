# House-Prices-Prediction

This Github repository contains the datasets and the script related to the Kaggle competition https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview.   

I used Machine Learning Regression models to accurately predict the Sales Price of houses, based upon the different attributes provided for those houses. I used the 'train.csv' to develop and train the model and used it to predict the Sales Price of houses in the 'test.csv'. The predicted Sales Price values are saved in a csv file 
'Predicted_values.csv'. Following files are included in this repository:    

1. Housing dataset.ipynb - script used for this project.   
2. Predicted_values.csv - csv file containing the predicted values.   
3. train.csv - training dataset.   
4. test.csv - testing dataset.
